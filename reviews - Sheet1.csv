"The things that I like abut Paul Quinn has to do with the work program and the soccer team. In the first place, I came to Paul Quinn College to play soccer and better myself in the sport.

"Honestly, I've never heard of Paul Quinn College until I visited during my Senior Week in high school. What I like most is that the President, Michael Sorrell, spoke to the student body of my high school. He asked each of us what did we want to major in and told us the majors Paul Quinn had to offer. From that day forward, I knew I belonged at Paul Quinn because there's not a chance that I would actually get a chance to meet a President of another college. Not only that, but he was very intellectual and I now look at him as a father figure. Besides updating the dormitory, that would be the only thing that needs to change."
I chose Paul Quinn College after the college president Dr. Sorrel spoke to me with such conviction and faith that I was going to be great and do good thing at the quinnite nation. with his love and the help of his staff i made my decision to become apart of the nation and i Dont have any bad feeling about my decision coming to PQC.
I Love PQC. Paul Quinn is super supportive of you and exposes you to many facets of life. I would not think or imagine of attending college anywhere else.

The safety and security on campus is very safe. They make that everyone on campus is safe as far as monitoring the campus and observing who comes in and out of campus.

COLLEGE REVIEW – VERY NICE RESPECTFUL TO ELDERS I THINK THAT THIS COLLEGE IS GREAT I DONT ATTEND BUT I HAVE VISIT MANY TIMES THIS IS AG O AL FOR ME TO ATTEND
So far this school is one of a kind. I love it and I’m looking forward to staying here another 3 years.
At the Quinnite Nation it's a great place to be at you can have so much fun being here with many different people that you have never meet or you barely see then at all. The college is very small and well organized. Also great thing is how everyone gets to know each other like its nothing new.
My experience here at Paul Quinn College has been a good experience for my first year to be in college.
"Paul Quinn College offers something unique to their students. We are not the average college we are the Quinnite nation, we hold our 4 ethos WE over Me true to our hearts. As a Quinnite I work hard to embody our 4 L's which are leave places better than you found them, to lead from wherever you are, to live a life that matters; and to love something greater than your self."
"My experience at Paul Quinn College (PQC) has been good. It had definitely been challenging as freshman, but the community of this college is very welcoming"
It a nice school and they have a lot of resources for the future. Its really hot down here but you'll get use to it after a while.They make you take well needed class in order for you to graduate.
Paul Quinn welcomes all. They are helpful and considers individuals that are less privileged. If you want to learn and grow this is the place to be.
When my school went to visit Paul Quinn I didn't think I would like it at first but when I sat down and actually listened and looked around I felt that it was a good match. The school is very clean and the student life seems good. The school wants to help all students with money issues as much as possible which I admire. When we were touring the school I noticed that the population is mostly African Americans which I like because most schools lack African Americans in the population. I feel as if this school would be a good choice for me because of the student to teacher ratio. I work better when the room isn't so packed and you can have one on one time with the professor.
"Very good institution if you are looking for a smaller more family like scene. Everyone knows everyone for the most part and there may be ups and downs to that trait, but I like it. Everyone is treated equally and fair. The teachers are great and the classes are fairly easy. Not only do we take classes, but as a urban work college we are required to work 10 hours a week. This teaches us how life will be in the real world. I would recommend this school to many people."
"My experience with Paul Quinn college has been a very good one. On the fact that the college is quite small and you get one on one time with your professors. And everybody seems to know everybody at this school. The school also has an unlimited range of resources that are available to both faculty, staff, and students. Such as libraries, "
College is small but it is in the process of growing. I am enjoying my experience at school. Nothing can be perfect but college is working hard to improve their campus and student life. It takes time and patience. I am glad to part of HBCU school because I am looking to live from a different perspective.
"I love that that Paul Quinn College is the first college work program, which allows students to have on campus jobs. Meaning some of the money we work for goes towards our tuition and the rest in our pockets. Paul Quinn College wants the best for everyone to make sure you have a successful future."
Paul Quinn is very welcoming and tiny. Great for Business majors. Really prepares you for real work.
"Currently I attend Paul Quinn College and so far l like it. Its only my second semester of mt freshman year but its great. One thing that i admire is that the professors ,their very hands on with their students . They were very helpful and understanding. The College is very helpful and teaches their students to be very responsibility adults. The College also enforces a dress code we have to dress in business wear. Which I think is a good rule. One thing i think should the College should change is the work study programs. The reason of that because I think it should be optional."
My experience at Paul Quinn College has been wonderful. Paul Quinn College is very family oriented and makes you feel apart of something without getting lost in the crowd.
"I love how Paul Quinn College is very involved in their students success. If you are struggling to achieve something, everyone pitches in to help you. The slogan WE over Me is a tremendous process that teaches you that your not alone and it is okay to help others as well as yourself."
The school provides lots of opportunities for students and defiantly helps you get your foot in the door.
Paul Quinn is a good college program to be apart of. simply because they teach you right from wrong from the start and they teach you how to be presentable at all times.
"Very small ,but well organized HBCU. Maintains great professionalism at all times while enjoy the company of many guest speakers. Great first year experience for me as well as my daughter."
"My experience while attending Paul Quinn College was great. I love the teacher to student ratio. Why? Is because we knew our Professors and we the student were not just a number. The atmosphere at Paul Quinn was more of a family atmosphere. What I mean by that, is our ethos ""We/Me"", and that is saying that we can reach out to each other about any and everything."
"Paul Quinn is an outstanding school a college located in South Dallas, but outstanding in academics and student life. Being a private school the student to teacher ratio is perfect small classes and the teacher knows every student. Sports just started in this college so they are not that great as other colleges, but they will soon get their. The experience is wonderful and I encourage high school student or students that are looking to transfer to always take a look at this small private institution."
It is a great school to start new things and become a leader and lead greatly. It definitely prepares you for the real world after college.
I like Paul Quinn because it is a Christian base school. I do think that they need some improvement with communicating a little better with non-traditional students like myself. I cant speak for students who are on campus but because I am not on campus and I don't have access to just walk to the financial aid departments or the registrar made it a little difficult. The trouble that I had was with them answering phones calls and returning messages and emails. I had to call several times to get one question answered. Overall I think it is a good school but I really wish they could improve on their phone system.
"My experience here at Paul Quinn has been a great experience. I learned a ton while in both the class room and while exploring the campus and the city around the institution. Paul Quinn Provided support for me as I transition into the colleague level of school. they have a great tutoring program that assist many of the kids who take hard courses. The institution Is also allowing me to start my own Car washing services on campus. This help me personality in two ways. I will acquire the knowledge it takes to lead a business. secondly, this help me pay for the remaining tuition. with this skill I we be more responsible when it comes to the real world. Even though Paul Quinn is a small school the professor and the staff of the school ask the students to think big."
Campus security is visible and present in all times.
needs improvement all over the campus
Just improve. Need more things for the students to do
"I mean it's open, just jump the gate and you in this thing"
Greek life is the thing to be on campus
My overall experience at Paul Quinn College is great because of the people that are here.
Intership is very important on our campus.
professors are the one who keeps the campus alive not the students
There is a lot of safety because there isn't that many of us.
The Greeks try their best to turn up !!
Everything went smooth and great.
"It is very good, everyone is on top of their stuff."
"As an incoming freshman in Fall 2014 we did not have a multicultural sorority. In Spring 2015 semester the first multicultural sorority was founded on campus. I think ALL greeks are easy to get along with and not only like to party, but help out their community."
"As an incoming freshman in Fall 2014 we did not have a girls soccer team. Now that we have both, there is a lot more people that are interested in the school. Both teams play great and I can't wait to see them play this Fall!"
There is always someone a person can go to on campus if they ever felt threatened or harmed in anyway.
The Greek life on campus is what brings the campus to life. Greeks try an involve the whole school in their activities and community service. They try and do a lot of social events to get everyone together. Non-Greeks lookup to Greeks to bring more fun into the school.
it hard but pushed you to do better
it seem good I am not in the Greek life
The only thing we have to worry about is the coyotes.
There are some improvements that can and are being made
all the students are doing well in there career of chioce
there seems to be very qualified instructors here
the campus seems to be very safe
im not on campaus but the grounds look wonderful
ive seen good representation on the campus
they seem to love the school
They are very friendly and cooperative.
This school provides a lot of opportunities.
"It has been a very interesting experience, making new friends and learning how to represent myself."
I think its pretty well
The experience that I have gotten from Paul Quinn College has been pretty good. My school is very family oriented and the professors are always free for one on ones.
great the teachers at Paul Quinn College help us ever step of the way
I am very satisfied with the chose I made with choosing Paul Quinn College to attend for the next four years of my life. I have one on one's with my professor's because we have a small size of students per classrooms. Which benefits me as the students by engaging better in the discussion everyday.
This school is really good.
"Financial aid is okay for the most part this semester, but last semester it was very unorganized."
Living on campus is not all bad. Our dorm rooms are bigger than some PWI Schools and I feel very safe and at home while i'm on campus.
it is somewhere in the middle
I love my financial aid team
The administration is good and the faculty are understanding and love to help you.
I really hoppe I receive a scholarship so that I can persue an education easy as possible.
There are many places to choose from by the school. Fast food laces to the diners to the restaurants
The parties are unbelievable and the scenes be so crowded it is ridiculous.
The classroom settings are great and the teachers make it easy to learn.
