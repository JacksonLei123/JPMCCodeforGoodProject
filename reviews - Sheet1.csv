It is a very wonderful experience living here. And learning to live in a whole other environment. It is a very wonderful and incredible experience one that i would have never thought i would like so much. The people here make living here so much bareable and easy to live at.

"The things that I like abut Paul Quinn has to do with the work program and the soccer team. In the first place, I came to Paul Quinn College to play soccer and better myself in the sport.

I love how Paul Quinn College is very diverse with there students and opening to better education more.
"Honestly, I've never heard of Paul Quinn College until I visited during my Senior Week in high school. What I like most is that the President, Michael Sorrell, spoke to the student body of my high school. He asked each of us what did we want to major in and told us the majors Paul Quinn had to offer. From that day forward, I knew I belonged at Paul Quinn because there's not a chance that I would actually get a chance to meet a President of another college. Not only that, but he was very intellectual and I now look at him as a father figure. Besides updating the dormitory, that would be the only thing that needs to change."
I chose Paul Quinn College after the college president Dr. Sorrel spoke to me with such conviction and faith that I was going to be great and do good thing at the quinnite nation. with his love and the help of his staff i made my decision to become apart of the nation and i Dont have any bad feeling about my decision coming to PQC.
I Love PQC. Paul Quinn is super supportive of you and exposes you to many facets of life. I would not think or imagine of attending college anywhere else.
My experience at Paul Quinn college has been acceptable. I would change the fact that we are in a food desert and its hard to commute places.

Their very friendly and outgoing everyone at the school is respectful at all times its not as strict as I thought it would be but I don't have any problems with anything.
Security monitors the campus as well as campus actitivies. Discretion is highly advised.

COLLEGE REVIEW – VERY NICE RESPECTFUL TO ELDERS I THINK THAT THIS COLLEGE IS GREAT I DONT ATTEND BUT I HAVE VISIT MANY TIMES THIS IS AG O AL FOR ME TO ATTEND
So far this school is one of a kind. I love it and I’m looking forward to staying here another 3 years.
At the Quinnite Nation it's a great place to be at you can have so much fun being here with many different people that you have never meet or you barely see then at all. The college is very small and well organized. Also great thing is how everyone gets to know each other like its nothing new.
My experience here at Paul Quinn College has been a good experience for my first year to be in college.
"Paul Quinn College offers something unique to their students. We are not the average college we are the Quinnite nation, we hold our 4 ethos WE over Me true to our hearts. As a Quinnite I work hard to embody our 4 L's which are leave places better than you found them, to lead from wherever you are, to live a life that matters; and to love something greater than your self."
"My experience at Paul Quinn College (PQC) has been good. It had definitely been challenging as freshman, but the community of this college is very welcoming"
It a nice school and they have a lot of resources for the future. Its really hot down here but you'll get use to it after a while.They make you take well needed class in order for you to graduate.
Paul Quinn welcomes all. They are helpful and considers individuals that are less privileged. If you want to learn and grow this is the place to be.
When my school went to visit Paul Quinn I didn't think I would like it at first but when I sat down and actually listened and looked around I felt that it was a good match. The school is very clean and the student life seems good. The school wants to help all students with money issues as much as possible which I admire. When we were touring the school I noticed that the population is mostly African Americans which I like because most schools lack African Americans in the population. I feel as if this school would be a good choice for me because of the student to teacher ratio. I work better when the room isn't so packed and you can have one on one time with the professor.
"Very good institution if you are looking for a smaller more family like scene. Everyone knows everyone for the most part and there may be ups and downs to that trait, but I like it. Everyone is treated equally and fair. The teachers are great and the classes are fairly easy. Not only do we take classes, but as a urban work college we are required to work 10 hours a week. This teaches us how life will be in the real world. I would recommend this school to many people."
"My experience with Paul Quinn college has been a very good one. On the fact that the college is quite small and you get one on one time with your professors. And everybody seems to know everybody at this school. The school also has an unlimited range of resources that are available to both faculty, staff, and students. Such as libraries, "
College is small but it is in the process of growing. I am enjoying my experience at school. Nothing can be perfect but college is working hard to improve their campus and student life. It takes time and patience. I am glad to part of HBCU school because I am looking to live from a different perspective.
"I love that that Paul Quinn College is the first college work program, which allows students to have on campus jobs. Meaning some of the money we work for goes towards our tuition and the rest in our pockets. Paul Quinn College wants the best for everyone to make sure you have a successful future."
Paul Quinn is very welcoming and tiny. Great for Business majors. Really prepares you for real work.
"Currently I attend Paul Quinn College and so far l like it. Its only my second semester of mt freshman year but its great. One thing that i admire is that the professors ,their very hands on with their students . They were very helpful and understanding. The College is very helpful and teaches their students to be very responsibility adults. The College also enforces a dress code we have to dress in business wear. Which I think is a good rule. One thing i think should the College should change is the work study programs. The reason of that because I think it should be optional."
My experience at Paul Quinn College has been wonderful. Paul Quinn College is very family oriented and makes you feel apart of something without getting lost in the crowd.
"I love how Paul Quinn College is very involved in their students success. If you are struggling to achieve something, everyone pitches in to help you. The slogan WE over Me is a tremendous process that teaches you that your not alone and it is okay to help others as well as yourself."
The school provides lots of opportunities for students and defiantly helps you get your foot in the door.
Paul Quinn is a good college program to be apart of. simply because they teach you right from wrong from the start and they teach you how to be presentable at all times.
"Very small ,but well organized HBCU. Maintains great professionalism at all times while enjoy the company of many guest speakers. Great first year experience for me as well as my daughter."
"My experience while attending Paul Quinn College was great. I love the teacher to student ratio. Why? Is because we knew our Professors and we the student were not just a number. The atmosphere at Paul Quinn was more of a family atmosphere. What I mean by that, is our ethos ""We/Me"", and that is saying that we can reach out to each other about any and everything."
"Paul Quinn is an outstanding school a college located in South Dallas, but outstanding in academics and student life. Being a private school the student to teacher ratio is perfect small classes and the teacher knows every student. Sports just started in this college so they are not that great as other colleges, but they will soon get their. The experience is wonderful and I encourage high school student or students that are looking to transfer to always take a look at this small private institution."
It is a great school to start new things and become a leader and lead greatly. It definitely prepares you for the real world after college.
I like Paul Quinn because it is a Christian base school. I do think that they need some improvement with communicating a little better with non-traditional students like myself. I cant speak for students who are on campus but because I am not on campus and I don't have access to just walk to the financial aid departments or the registrar made it a little difficult. The trouble that I had was with them answering phones calls and returning messages and emails. I had to call several times to get one question answered. Overall I think it is a good school but I really wish they could improve on their phone system.
"My experience here at Paul Quinn has been a great experience. I learned a ton while in both the class room and while exploring the campus and the city around the institution. Paul Quinn Provided support for me as I transition into the colleague level of school. they have a great tutoring program that assist many of the kids who take hard courses. The institution Is also allowing me to start my own Car washing services on campus. This help me personality in two ways. I will acquire the knowledge it takes to lead a business. secondly, this help me pay for the remaining tuition. with this skill I we be more responsible when it comes to the real world. Even though Paul Quinn is a small school the professor and the staff of the school ask the students to think big."
Campus security is visible and present in all times.
needs improvement all over the campus
Just improve. Need more things for the students to do
"I mean it's open, just jump the gate and you in this thing"
Greek life is the thing to be on campus
My overall experience at Paul Quinn College is great because of the people that are here.
Intership is very important on our campus.
professors are the one who keeps the campus alive not the students
There is a lot of safety because there isn't that many of us.
The Greeks try their best to turn up !!
Everything went smooth and great.
"It is very good, everyone is on top of their stuff."
"As an incoming freshman in Fall 2014 we did not have a multicultural sorority. In Spring 2015 semester the first multicultural sorority was founded on campus. I think ALL greeks are easy to get along with and not only like to party, but help out their community."
"As an incoming freshman in Fall 2014 we did not have a girls soccer team. Now that we have both, there is a lot more people that are interested in the school. Both teams play great and I can't wait to see them play this Fall!"
There is always someone a person can go to on campus if they ever felt threatened or harmed in anyway.
The Greek life on campus is what brings the campus to life. Greeks try an involve the whole school in their activities and community service. They try and do a lot of social events to get everyone together. Non-Greeks lookup to Greeks to bring more fun into the school.
it hard but pushed you to do better
it seem good I am not in the Greek life
The only thing we have to worry about is the coyotes.
There are some improvements that can and are being made
all the students are doing well in there career of chioce
there seems to be very qualified instructors here
the campus seems to be very safe
im not on campaus but the grounds look wonderful
ive seen good representation on the campus
they seem to love the school
They are very friendly and cooperative.
This school provides a lot of opportunities.
"It has been a very interesting experience, making new friends and learning how to represent myself."
I think its pretty well
The experience that I have gotten from Paul Quinn College has been pretty good. My school is very family oriented and the professors are always free for one on ones.
great the teachers at Paul Quinn College help us ever step of the way
I am very satisfied with the chose I made with choosing Paul Quinn College to attend for the next four years of my life. I have one on one's with my professor's because we have a small size of students per classrooms. Which benefits me as the students by engaging better in the discussion everyday.
This school is really good.
"Financial aid is okay for the most part this semester, but last semester it was very unorganized."
Living on campus is not all bad. Our dorm rooms are bigger than some PWI Schools and I feel very safe and at home while i'm on campus.
it is somewhere in the middle
I love my financial aid team
The administration is good and the faculty are understanding and love to help you.
I really hoppe I receive a scholarship so that I can persue an education easy as possible.
There are many places to choose from by the school. Fast food laces to the diners to the restaurants
The parties are unbelievable and the scenes be so crowded it is ridiculous.
The classroom settings are great and the teachers make it easy to learn.
The health and condition could be a little better but the campus s so old so it can be excused.
I love the greeks. They make you want to consider going greek.
The campus is beautiful and the people here are wonderful. They really make you feel like you are at home.
"great experience ,to better my life"
everything on campus is good
"Admin is very supportive to student's ideas, but do not support students underage drinking or smoking"
"family oriented school, very helpful ,and its like a big family"
The academics offered at Paul Quinn College is excellent. We receive the quality instruction that will aid us in our academic and career endeavors.
The school recently just opened a new gym that is great
Living in Dallas Texas is a great atmosphere to live in because it is always something to do here. There are a lot of other colleges that are within a short driving distance from the school. it a great place to live after graduation as well because the job market her is high.
"Its not perfect, but its safe."
"My college is extremely diverse. Although it is an HBCU, Paul Quinn College has different races that attend the school. Political beliefs and religion beliefs are also extremely diverse and influential in our everyday lives, being that the college is a christian college. Chapel and other religious services are often being held on and off campus."
The academic teacher are very helpful and welling
The projects we work on around the center is good
If you can get to them.
I didn't have any problems dealing with my financial aid everything went good. I'm currently going to school with no debt and I'm able to attend classes with out paying any extra money at all.
"There is a need to have your own car if you have a busy lifestyle, or don't live on campus. however there is access to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit that stops in front of the campus."
"I am happy with my selected major. I feel this major will give me the flexibility to work for myself or work for a company if I choose. I am not finished with the courses in my major, so I will have to prepare for what is to come right now. I am somewhat concerned that my experience level will need to be high in order to land a job or career."
I would advise any student to look at the current job market. Look at which fields will allow you to be paid the way you feel you need to be paid once you are finished with your attendance requirements. Doing this research before selecting a major will be very helpful.
"Attraction areas are easy to find in the city of Dallas. There are a great amount of sports teams, museums, dining venues, and other entertainment areas to participate in"
"Professors are always there when you need them. Due to the campus containing about 1500 students, this gives the students a more focused foundation of learning in the classrooms. There are a great around of study areas around the college campus."
I would advise anyone looking to attend this college to apply early. To come in and visit the campus to discuss any and all options. Deadlines apply to all scholarships and financial aid.
"This campus is very diverse. There students here from different countries. economic backgrounds, faiths, and sexual orientations."
Most of the National Pan-Hellenic Council sororities and fraternities are represented at Paul Quinn. Like any HBCU Greek life is a major part of college life. There are currently no special Greek housing available.
"The downtown Dallas area offers a lot of choices for nightlife There are plenty of clubs, bars, and lounges. You will need a car or take the DART system for transportation."
Basketball and Soccer are the most popular sports at Paul Quinn. The college great scholarships and support to student athletes.
"Paul Quinn's admission process is simple, I think it is best to have a good essay and turn in all of your documents correctly and on time."
To enter Paul Quinn's campus you have to go through a security gate. So security on campus good.
Paul Quinn college is a small school and has a close knit family feel. The college has a big emphasis on preparing students for the real world. Many work program and internships are available to all students. it's easy to get to know your professors and fellow classmates. Paul Quinn College is committed 100% to student success.
"If you know the secret menu, you'll be fine."
I hear we're suppose to get a new dorm next year.
You can always find out about parties through word of mouth.
"The school requires you to apply to two scholarships per semester. At first, I didn't get it, but then I actually got a scholarship that I wasn't expecting."
"You have to apply for internships while you are in school, not just your senior year."

There are always computers available in the lab
"For an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), Paul Quinn attracts students from other ethnic backgrounds besides the African American ethnic culture."
Paul Quinn is very strict on its drug and alcohol policy.....nuff said
The computers at my school has access to everything. You can use them at anytime of the day.
You can find anything to do off campus. Its up to you and who you with to go to the place.
It can be rough and hard to keep your focus because of freedom but with the staff and friends that are on campus everyone looks out for each other and try to help whatever the situation maybe.
I believe our Dorm Coordinator is strict in a good way.
The atmosphere to me is welcoming.
PQC is open and welcoming every student.
I think the campus dining are doing great so far.
The security is very alert and attentive.
"It is pretty good. There are a lot of options. We have the hot line where they serve the more traditional food and we have the salad bar, the grill the sandwich line and the station where they cook pastas and stir fry fresh."
I Would say being at the school I am at was a great choice. It is small and they have better hands on teaching.
I like the staff and i think for the money we pay we are doing good
I know that their is a zero tolerance for underage drinking
I really dont have a problem we normally walk to class
They only get involved when things get out of hand
Any organization tries to set the atmosphere on campus.
We are good but there is always room for better
We are 15 minutes outside of downtown Dallas. And their is a lot do outside of the campus you just have to be willing to go there.
we have a very small campus
how the students interact with each other its a small campus. 
There are no criminal problems on campus
It is a small school and everyone knows everyone. The professors are very easilly accessible.
you can almost park anywhere.
They get the job done.
I can not describe the off campus housing section at my school simply because we do not have one.
I currently am serving my internship in the Communications Department and currently I love it I have learned alot.
So far it has a great experience
The academic aspect is improving.
I have not had a chance to experience my major.
"Not many students have cars, which makes it easy."
The campus is just like high school. Everyone is in different cliques.
"My school is a very great school, if you want one-on-one attention with your professors. My school is located in the heart of Dallas, therefore there is much to observe and learn. Also Paul Quinn is about twenty minutes from downtown to discover new and fun adventures!"
Paul Quinn College academics are very good and they offer different classes such as becoming an entrepreneur and things of that nature.
Since the beginning of the semester the campus security is very nice and friendly and they take there jobs seriously. Not only do you have to use your ID to get inside campus but the police greets you pass the gates.
you honestly do not need a car on campus and the permit if you do have one is not expensive.
The food is good you don't have to play a guessing gaming about what your eating.
"Students have access to computers anytime. Some students own personal labtops which they can operate from their dorm room. Those that do not own a labtop can use the Library, Student Writing Center, or Dorm Computer Lab."
Since I am 23 there is no limit as far as what I can and cannot do.
"There are great dining options off campus.They are economical, in walking distance if you do not have a car. Seafood shops, hamburgers shops, barbeque."
I would like to eventually earn a masters in psycology . My program is going rather good since im only taking basics. I believe I will accomplish my dream of opening an A.A counseling center.
I do not own a car but parking space is always available for those that do own a vehicle.
I feel as if the teachers are very hands on with students and are willing to work more with the students. The teachers go the extra mile for students and are really dedicated.
Paul Quinn's campus is amazing because they are full of friendly people who respect each other. The staff is wonderful and they care about every student. There's the cafeteria where they serve wonderful food. Not but least the president of school Mr. Sorrell is an outstanding man.
my current curriculum for my major at paul quin is satisfying they have a large variety of courses to take.
"I had little to no difficulties, only trouble i had was recieving loan funding."
"I enjoy the small environment of the the school and the passion of current and past Quinnites. I would like to see the faculty be more approachable in order to help promote a better understanding of the content being taught. Some of the courses that I was placed into, did not necessarily go towards my plan nor will be recognized as transferable credits if I choose to attend another school. I was not aware of this until half way through the semester. I would like the administration to be more organized and communicate more with all the students. Healthier choices in the cafeteria are greatly needed!"
My experience has been great and I have been able to learn many things that will help me in the future and will make me a better person. I also learned some new things from my self that u never thought that I would have. Paul Quinn has been a really fun experience because I have done my work and I’m doing great in class.
The thing that i like about Paul Quinn College is that is not that really big college and we as a family and always there to support each other and never let nobody behind.
"I am currently a Junior at Paul Quinn and over the course of my experience I've been excited about how much I have watched Paul Quinn GROW. At first, I was nervous about attending Paul Quinn because the school was located an area/state that I have never been before. As an out of state student, Paul Quinn is my family away from home. I know that if I am under any stress or need help with whatever it may be I can get help. I am appreciative of PQC."
"paul quinn is a very united school everyone know each other and people treat each other like family, this school make students dress in a business casual to prepare the students for the future."
"I like the school, it has a lot of potential to be so much greater than what it is now. I don’t like how the people run it, I feel it is very discombobulated and nothing is ever being done how it’s suppose to."
"What I liked about Paul Quinn College was the sports more than anything, and also the atmosphere. The students and teammates who help you get through those difficult times of life."
"Paul Quinn College is a relatively decent. It is not among the best, but it is working on it and the school is gradually there. Their work program is very insightful and provides work experience."
"The campus is very out to dated, it needs some remodeling. The community that it is can be scary because anything can happen at a given moment."
"I have dislikes and likes about Paul Quinn. Paul Quinn is a school that you have to wear business casual, which I like. The college is very strict, and is more like a high school. The food is horrible, and the internet is horrible also. The professors are not real with they self."
"The school has a fun atmosphere but as far as the college life it is not what one expects. The teachers are not what college teachers should be for the most part, also their is a good bit of favoritism from the president here in the school and with sports. Overall it is OK but there needs to be a lot of improvements."
Paul Quinn College is an okay school. They have really great staff. The students don't really complain about much but the dorms and the boring parties. The dorms are really old and a lot of the times things are always broken.
This is a great institution. It however is not publicized like some of the other colleges in Dallas. They need family housing and social workers to help students whom are homeless.
"This school is a non-profit. If someone attends here, do not expect the more beautiful things around."
My School is very unique because it may not be the most financial and luxurious school. The President does his best to try to get everyone to graduate with as little debt as possible.
I don't know what to say
"Not bad, but needs a lot of improving. Lets be about the students and the campus itself."
"Athletics is okay here at Paul Quinn College. Honestly, there is a lack of school spirit."
Not into the Greek life
I'm an off campus student so i dont get to experience the on campus college life
I.m an office campus student so i really couldn't tell you
They don't give everyone opportunities.
Well it's better than nothing. People can be loud at times but that's not really a problem
I really don't pay attention to greek life. it doesn't really call my attention.
It's okay because it's just small. There's nothing to really do most of the time.
Need to be more drug safer
"It is good to live on campus, no bills."
It is enough security I feel safe.
"Paul Quinn College athletic programs mainly are just basketball and soccer. Athletics aren't something that's big huge on campus, but the student body does go to support when there is a game."
not most use of drugs
the woods and animals could get me
Paul Quinn College is slowly growing but it is a work in progress.
The academics at my schools are every general at every other college.
The diversity on campus is very diverse and good.
Drugs are prohibited on campus.
"Outside of campus it is not safe, but on campus is very safe."
I value my degree from my school because its an excellent program.
My courses are vey easy for a freshman.
living on campus is very difficult with 100 people in one dorm.
Greek life on campus is really interesting.
"my school only has two sports which are soccer and basketball, so they both are interesting sports."
"My school is every small, so they are very supportive with each students dreams and goals."
"The campus is not known for violence, it is generally safe."
Some room are nice and others are bad to live in.
Off campus parties are wack to me.
They don't really have all the majors you want .
Everyone is usually nice to each other but Hispanics and black don't sit together .
People get drunk but they do it off campus .
They try and help all students if you meet the requirements.
Classes are small and you get more one on one than at a big school.
Not a lot of support from school .
"Students contaste smoke un campus but when they get back from smoking, they stink up the hallways"
You can still leave here but some rooms are either too cold or too hot.
"The school I attend now is Paul Quinn College, overall the school is not really what I expected. I have a love/hate relationship with my school. I love the fact that the school is small and it is hands on and allows you get that one on one time with the professors also the classes are much smaller. On the other hand the school doesn't have that many funds so we struggle for certain things."
The best thing about my school is that it is small and easy to contact staff and students. My only complaint would be that the staff is not organized.
I love the way the staffs and students help you with anything you may need.
it was a little hard looking for schools
I enjoyed every moment and if I could do it over I would change my apporch and study habits
not really a party person
I stay off campus but when im here its ok
Living off campus is okay and cheaper.
Its okay not yo live but not all boring.
The procesos was okay but I got it done.
Dame menú just about everything week.
"Its okay, lovely but surely doing renovaciones"
Students only attend home games and they have to be basketball games
Some Greeks are friendly others act as though they don't want to be there and are mean.
The housing is not that bad near our campus but it is not safe.
"Its just what I like, small and personal."
you need a car to get there but it is okay
